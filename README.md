## California Wildfires and Climate Change      

**California wildfires have affected not only residents of California, but communities across the US. Many in California have been directly impacted by wildfires spreading through their communities, and others, both in California and other states, have experienced poor air quality due to particulate matter produced by the fires. Weâ€™re interested in condensing down the following topics and creating visuals that can be referenced by the general public to better understand the causes, effects, and risks of California wildfires. In doing so, we hope to be able to identify ways in which the general public can actively work to reduce wildfires in California.    

> - Investigating the effects of climate change on wildfires in California. 
> - What is the effect of prolonged drought in California on the severity and frequency of wildfires?  
> - What communities are affected by wildfires and how?  
> - What is the effect of increasing global temperatures on wildfire severity and frequency?    
> - Have wildfires intensified in recent years?  
> - How can we reduce wildfires in California?
